# Intro

J is an array programming language of APL family [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)). I discovered it through a talk from StrangeLoop [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWYkx6-L04Q).
Being fan of learning programming languages in general it immediately struck me as something totally different, something I have not seen before.

While this project is not a new effort and it has sophisticated documentation, I and many other people find it sometimes hard to approach.
In this book I will break down solutions for Advent of Code [3](adventofcode.com/) puzzles in J and explain some common primitives and their semantics.

This book is by no means a sophisticated guide to a language but hopefully it is useful enough to get more people started and make language more approachable.
