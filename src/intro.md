# Intro

J is an array programming laguage of APL family [1]. I discovered it through a talk from StrangeLoop [2].
Being fan of learning programming laguages in general it immediately struck me as something totally different, something I have not seen before.

While this project is not a new effort and it has sophisticated documentation, I and many other people find it sometimes hard to approach.
In this book I will break down solutoins for Advent of Code [3] puzzles in J and explain some common primitives and their semantics.

This book is by no means a sophisticated guide to a langauge but hopefully it is useful enough to get more people started and make language more approachable.
